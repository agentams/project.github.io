Want to see how ancient villages used to look like? Head down to Mohan Shakti Heritage Park and step right into the past. Just half an hour drive from Solan, the Mohan Shakti Heritage Park is an ultimate place to visit. Mohan Shakti Heritage Park is North India's first ever ancient heritage park. National Heritage Park is located at Shakti Sthal on NH 22 between Kalka and Shimla. The picturesque park is supplemented with many unique structures. The park is still under construction and is believed to be the largest heritage park in Himachal Pradesh. Here, tourist can enjoy exploring a heritage park, pass through grasslands, indulge in bird watching, catch glimpses of archaeological sites, and gorgeous landscapes of peaks, clouds and sunshine.

Within the huge periphery of the park, there is a beautiful shrine, Kali Ka Tibba temple. The shrine seems like an emerald amidst the wilderness. The entire complex of Heritage Park is dotted with multiple statues, sculptures and statuettes. Huge statues of Indian Gods and Goddesses can be seen here. Unique animals made of plaster of Paris (POP) are the main attractions of the park.

Inside the complex of Heritage Park, there are herbal therapy centres, community kitchens, theme parks, residential blocks, temples, study centres, open theatres and ropeway trolleys. This heritage park was built with the purpose to promote Vedic Sciences as a topic of interest for the younger generation and also to preach them about Indian culture. Mohan Shakti Heritage Park is the profound creation of Mr Kapil Mohan, Brigadier General of the Indian army by profession. He (Kapil Mohan) made this heritage site with a vision to nurture the Vedic Sciences as a subject.

Located in the midst of great mountains, Mohan Shakti Heritage Park is an exceptional place. The park is an amazing initiative to revive the Vedic lifestyle.
